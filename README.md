# IEEE802.11ad

PHY layer simulation of a directional, multi-gigabit wireless system

## Requirements 

All simulations are written in MATLAB2019b, and require the DSP and Comms Toolboxes. 
## Basic Usage
To simulate the standard over an AWGN channel, please see `wls.m` 

In that file, you can specify a modulation and coding scheme, the amount of data, the number of frames and the range of SNR values to compute bit error rates for.
